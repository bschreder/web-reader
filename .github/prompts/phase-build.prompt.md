Review Phase 5 `.github/project-plan.md`.
Review previous phases for completeness and quality.
Review existing implementation.

- Implement best practices without consideration for existing code.
- Focus on code quality, testing, and maintainability.
- All files can be changed or deleted.
- Implement typings and type hints where missing.
- Ensure code is modular and follows SOLID principles.

Project work order:
- Implement missing features from previous phases based on this project order.
- Implement new features only after previous phases are complete based on this project order.
  1. FastMCP
  2. LangChain
  3. Backend
  4. Frontend

Deliverables:

- Updated codebase with improved structure, tests, and documentation.
- All test and coverage criteria met. Restructure as necessary. Use reasonable effort to reach targets.
- Implement integration and e2e tests. Update, as necessary, the README.TEST.md with instructions on running tests based on `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`.
- Use reasonable effort to fix lint errors in ./src and ./tests folders.
- When done,
  1.  a user can run all tests from within the devcontainer shell.
  2.  a user can run an e2e workflow test that covers a typical use case.
