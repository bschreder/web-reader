Review Phase 3 `.github/project-plan.md`.
Review existing implementation.

- Implement best practices without consideration for existing code.
- Focus on code quality, testing, and maintainability.
- All files can be changed or deleted.
- Implement typings and type hints where missing.
- Ensure code is modular and follows SOLID principles.

  Deliverables:

  - Updated codebase with improved structure, tests, and documentation.
  - All test and coverage criteria met. Restructure as necessary. Use reasonable effort to reach targets.
  - Implement integration and e2e tests. Update, as necessary, the README.TEST.md with instructions on running tests.
  - Fix all lint errors in ./src and ./tests folders. Use reasonable effort to fix lint errors.
  - When done,
    1.  a user can run all tests from within the devcontainer shell.
    2.  a user can run an e2e workflow test that covers a typical use case.
